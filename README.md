Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project in the GPIO Interrupt was setting up a thermostat that would take the temperature from the room, and turn on the heat if the temperature was lower than the set temperature, which was simulated by the turning on of a red LED light. The set temperature could be increased or decresed using the two buttons on the launchpad board.

What did you do particularly well?
I think that I set up my switch statements paticularly well and ensured that my code was properly commented and decomposited my code for easier managing of the program, upkeep in the future, and reusing code.
-
Where could you improve?
I think I could improve on ensuring that I keep to all requirements. In teh PWM LED I did not notice that the wait times and strength for the different lights were different and I just set them to the same wait time and strength. In the GPIO Interrupt when I was doing the report, I needed to consider multiple boards but I focused on only 1.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The main tools that I use are GeekforGeeks and StackOverflow which are amazing support networks for software development.
-
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Beyond getting a foundation for my embedded system knowledge, this course gave me huge insight on how to utilize switch statements, and that will be useful in future projects and course work regardless of the type of software development.
-
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I focused on functional decomposition and good commenting to make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable. With smaller functions that are commented properly, I could adapt the functions to other projects, understand what they are meant to do, and keep them working properly in the future.
